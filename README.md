# ASP.NET_MVC_Assignments
For this assignment, you are to create an MVC Web Application from scratch. Use the ASP.NET Core Web Application project type, and the “Web Application (Model-View-Controller)” template to start with. This will give you the basic structure to build your project from.

Required Features:

 General file structure of a MVC project.

 A Layout file for your views to use. It should contain:
 
 A header element, containing a page logo and a navigation menu.
 
A container to be filled with each view.
 
 A footer, containing the current date as an object, and your name.
 
 
 A controller with at least three views:
 
 About – Containing information about yourself (CV).
 
 Contact – Containing your contact information.
 
 Projects – Containing the assignments and projects you have finished
 
 
 *Forms and Inputs*
 
Add a view to the existing page that takes a temperature in number form, checks how high it is, and tells you whether you have a fever or not. Define a custom route to reach it – “/FeverCheck” should redirect to this new page, rather than having to specify a controller and action.

Required Features:

• A form that takes a single numeric value (float or integer) and sends it on to a controller action.

• The value should be interpreted as a temperature and checked against the thresholds for fever.

• A message should appear on the page, showing whether you have a fever or not.
